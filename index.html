        <h2>News:</h2>
        <h3>It's been a crazy month. 07/27/24</h3>
        <p id="new52721">Lots of major things happened this month. Firstly, the server has been updated to a new version of the WiiLink backend (It adds in some small security patches and some backend code for TT leaderboards); However since the server has been updated, <b>you will need to update the codes you are using to connect.</b> Secondly, The server's main location has now been moved to Houston, TX. Outside of that, We had our longest session ever! The session came in at around 26-32 hours and was mainly played by Me (Discord: imzeraora) and Kai (Discord: kaitherikkor0830). Well, that is all from this update. See y'all on the flip side!
        </p>

        <h3>It's alive... ALIVE! 06/19/24</h3>
        <p id="new52721">Well... Well... Well... What do we have here? Oh nothing, just a MASSIVE UPDATE! The server has gone from the old DWC emulator to the new WiiLink24 server backend! This improves stability, adds features like open host, among other things.

            for accessing NinjaWFC. Please visit the "Codes" and update accordingly.
